### Work Experience 
Business Data Analyst at Anheuser-Busch InBev
-  Utilised data visualisation tools like Power BI and R to make useful insights on business development.
-  Conducted data collection, cleaning, processing and analysis for procurement and sales team significantly influencing decision-making and ensuring the continuation of the business.
-  Conducted root cause analysis using Python and Excel to review logistic costs, resulting in savings exceeding 20% of the total procurement spend. 

## Projects
### Project 1: Loan Defaulters Analysis

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of loan defaulters using data sourced from Kaggle. The process began with data cleaning and transformation to ensure accuracy and reliability. I then performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset, focusing on key factors such as age, sex, and income.
To predict the likelihood of loan default, I developed a logistic regression model. This model was implemented using SAS, Python and R Studio, where I conducted preprocessing, visualization, and comparative analysis. Through this comparison, I highlighted the efficiency of Python in handling similar tasks.

The analysis led to the identification of actionable insights regarding default risk factors, which were thoroughly documented in a final report.

#### Key Contributions:

-  Data Analysis: Analyzed loan application data, ensuring data integrity and accuracy using SAS, Python and R Studio.
-  Model Development: Created a logistic regression model to predict default probabilities.
-  Tool Utilization: Leveraged SAS, Python and R Studio for preprocessing, visualization, and model comparison.
-  Insights Generation: Identified key risk factors contributing to loan defaults and provided actionable insights for risk mitigation.

### Project 2: Crime Analysis and Population Distribution in Derbyshire
In this project, I conducted a thorough analysis of the 2019 population distribution and crime density across 642 regions in Derbyshire using R studio to better understand crime patterns. The process began with data preprocessing, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to ensure a solid understanding of the dataset.

#### Key Contributions:

-  Population Distribution Analysis: Analyzed population distribution across the 642 regions to identify potential links to crime patterns.
-  Correlation Exploration: Investigated correlations between population density and 14 crime variables, including Anti-Social Behaviour and Burglary.
-  Crime Variable Descriptions: Provided comprehensive descriptions of each crime variable to enhance understanding and context for further analysis.
-  Model Development: Established correlations between crime rates and population densities using linear regression models, aiding in the development of crime reduction strategies.
-  Data Visualization: Utilized a variety of visual tools, including histograms, scatterplots, treemaps, and geospatial maps, to effectively illustrate crime frequency and population distribution.

### Project 3: Bank Churners and Video Game Sales Data Analysis
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis of the bank churners and video game sales datasets using R Studio. The goal was to derive meaningful insights into customer behavior and sales trends through a series of rigorous statistical tests and modeling techniques.

#### Bank Churners Analysis
Data Overview: Analyzed a dataset comprising 10,127 bank customers, focusing on attributes such as age, credit limit, and transaction behavior to understand factors influencing customer attrition.

-  One-Sample T-Test: Conducted a test to determine if the average age of customers deviates from 45 years. The analysis revealed a statistically significant difference, indicating that the average age is not 45.
-  Welch Two-Sample T-Test: Compared credit limits between male and female customers. Results showed a significant difference, with males having higher average credit limits than females.
-  ANOVA Test: Evaluated if credit limits vary across different card categories. The analysis demonstrated significant variability in credit limits among categories.
-  Linear Regression: Investigated the relationship between credit limit, customer age, and total transaction amount. The model identified credit limit and age as significant predictors, though the overall model explained only a small portion of the variance.
-  Chi-Square Test: Examined the independence of customer attrition from marital status. The test indicated no significant relationship between these variables.
-  Logistic Regression: Identified key predictors of customer attrition, including total transaction amount, gender, and card category. Age and credit limit were found to be non-significant in predicting attrition.


#### Video Game Sales Analysis
Data Overview: Analyzed video game sales data to explore sales trends across various platforms and genres globally.

-  Exploratory Analysis: Examined sales patterns, identifying Nintendo as a dominant player in global sales and highlighting popular genres like sports and platform games.
-  Correlation Exploration: Investigated relationships between sales figures in different regions and other variables to uncover significant sales trends and regional preferences.
-  Visualization: Created visual representations, such as histograms and scatterplots, to effectively communicate sales data trends and regional performance.
