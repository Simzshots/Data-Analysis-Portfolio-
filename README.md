## Projects
### Loan Defaulters Analysis

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of loan defaulters using data sourced from Kaggle. The process began with data cleaning and transformation to ensure accuracy and reliability. I then performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset, focusing on key factors such as age, sex, and income.
To predict the likelihood of loan default, I developed a logistic regression model. This model was implemented using SAS, Python and R Studio, where I conducted preprocessing, visualization, and comparative analysis. Through this comparison, I highlighted the efficiency of Python in handling similar tasks.

The analysis led to the identification of actionable insights regarding default risk factors, which were thoroughly documented in a final report.

#### Key Contributions:

-  Data Analysis: Analyzed loan application data, ensuring data integrity and accuracy using SAS, Python and R Studio.
-  Model Development: Created a logistic regression model to predict default probabilities.
-  Tool Utilization: Leveraged SAS, Python and R Studio for preprocessing, visualization, and model comparison.
-  Insights Generation: Identified key risk factors contributing to loan defaults and provided actionable insights for risk mitigation.
