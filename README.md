## Projects
### Loan Defaulters Analysis

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of loan defaulters using data sourced from Kaggle. The process began with data cleaning and transformation to ensure accuracy and reliability. I then performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset, focusing on key factors such as age, sex, and income.
To predict the likelihood of loan default, I developed a logistic regression model. This model was implemented using SAS, Python and R Studio, where I conducted preprocessing, visualization, and comparative analysis. Through this comparison, I highlighted the efficiency of Python in handling similar tasks.

The analysis led to the identification of actionable insights regarding default risk factors, which were thoroughly documented in a final report.

#### Key Contributions:

-  Data Analysis: Analyzed loan application data, ensuring data integrity and accuracy using SAS, Python and R Studio.
-  Model Development: Created a logistic regression model to predict default probabilities.
-  Tool Utilization: Leveraged SAS, Python and R Studio for preprocessing, visualization, and model comparison.
-  Insights Generation: Identified key risk factors contributing to loan defaults and provided actionable insights for risk mitigation.

### Crime Analysis and Population Distribution in Derbyshire
In this project, I conducted a thorough analysis of the 2019 population distribution across 642 regions in Derbyshire using R studio to better understand crime patterns. The process began with data preprocessing, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to ensure a solid understanding of the dataset.

#### Key Contributions:

-  Population Distribution Analysis: Analyzed population distribution across the 642 regions to identify potential links to crime patterns.
-  Correlation Exploration: Investigated correlations between population density and 14 crime variables, including Anti-Social Behaviour and Burglary.
-  Crime Variable Descriptions: Provided comprehensive descriptions of each crime variable to enhance understanding and context for further analysis.
-  Model Development: Established correlations between crime rates and population densities using linear regression models, aiding in the development of crime reduction strategies.
-  Data Visualization: Utilized a variety of visual tools, including histograms, scatterplots, treemaps, and geospatial maps, to effectively illustrate crime frequency and population distribution.
